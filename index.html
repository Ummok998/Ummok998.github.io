        <h1>about me:</h1>
        <h2>hello! I'm luminosity. I have no true idea who I really am??? </h2>
        <h2>at this point, just use the pronoun you think I should use, <i>unless I specify otherwise.</i> </h2>
        <h2>otherwise, I really just do roblox game dev. I use python <i>sometimes</i> but don't count on that.</h2>
        <h2>k, I think I've taken enough time to explain who I am, let's go onto what I've done.</h2>

        <h1>what I've done.</h1>
        <h2>as a game dev (although it's on roblox so is it really game dev?), I've worked on a few things like:</h2>
        <h2>Flood Finale - a Flood Escape 2 fangame,</h2>
        <h2>"Glitchtale: The New Generation" - a Glitchtale fangame,</h2>
        <h2>"Undertale: Patience's Odyssey" - an Undertale fangame,</h2>
        <h2>and Shalmon, a Splatoon Salmon Run fangame</h2>
        <h3><sup>now that I think of it, I've worked on only fangames...</sup></h3>
        <h2>anyways, I haven't published many python scripts, and my github is really only goofy stuff.</h2>
        <h2>ok so I ran out of ideas, so I'm just going to put a bunch of random things down here just cause.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="box grow">
        <h1>my favorite things</h1>
        <h2>my favorite song is "The Code" by Nemo</h2>
        <h2>another thing I really like is the stupidity of the roblox studio community discord</h2>
        <h3><sup>(and I mean that in the nice way, y'all)</sup></h3>
        <h2>last thing I'll list is that my favorite game is currently obby royale.</h2>
